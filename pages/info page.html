                    This website is a hub, to show You (hopefully an employer) my skills in vanilla
                    HTML/CSS/JS. I thought of playing around with an API or making a theming
                    functionality, so I've put all of that in this website. The weather page has a
                    map of my home country (Lithuania) which is divided into districts using CSS
                    grid. Click me to go home
